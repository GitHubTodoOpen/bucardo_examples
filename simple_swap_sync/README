simple_swap_sync

This example sets up a simple 'swap' sync. 

'swap' is a multi-master synchronization method provided by Bucardo.

This example implements the conflict resolution type 'source', which
causes Bucardo to use the 'source' herd change in the event that
source and target changes conflict. 

The example creates an artificial conflict by stopping replication
temporarily and then restarting (see 7_script.sh).
