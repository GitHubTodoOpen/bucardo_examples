INSTALLATION

This system assumes that the following binaries are in your PATH: 

	bucardo_ctl
	psql

The scripts also assume that you've created a default database, with the user 'postgres'.

You can change the defaults around by judicious use of a ~/.pgpass and/or .bucardorc
files.

These scripts create and drop tables, so please don't be silly and run these on 
a production server. :)
